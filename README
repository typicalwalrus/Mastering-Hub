developed basic font end UI along with some style implementation. Need to further understand how to correctly upload and host files to the ecosystem.

Unsure of how the math function is going to work out as of right now, still need to add display outputs on the HTMl file and link them to the mathematical outputs off Script.js.

feel comfortable with this progress for the week, next priority is to attack hosting the file to run the calculations, as we haven't dealt with HTMl audio input in class yet.
